# Recurrent_Neural_Network-RNN
🧠 Customer Classification using Machine Learning
Predict customer churn using machine learning techniques on synthetic customer behavior data.

This project simulates real-world churn scenarios by generating customer data (e.g., age, gender, income, purchase frequency) and trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not. It includes data generation, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance tuning.

🔍 Key Features:
End-to-end ML pipeline with Jupyter Notebook

Synthetic dataset generation using NumPy and Pandas

Model evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualizations and insights on customer behavior

Clean and well-documented code with explanations

📦 Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn
